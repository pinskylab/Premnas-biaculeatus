# Premnas biaculeatus
 
Data files and analysis for the manuscript "Isolation by distance and isolation by oceanography in Maroon Anemonefish (Premnas biaculeatus)" focused on estimating the larval dispersal kernels of Premnas biaculeatus using Isolation-by-Distance genetic estimates and comparing genetic differentiation to probability of dispersal based on oceanographic simulations.

The repository is organized in the following folders:

Downloaded_Data: raw data files, unmanipulated by the authors.
   "Amphiprion_Microsats.csv" details on microsatellites screened for use. Used to develop Tables 1 and S1.
    "coral_all_release_site_coarse.nc" from Thompson et al. 2018. Latitude and longitude for particle release sites used in potential connectivity analyses.
    "CORAL-connect_25_historical_pconnect_10-day_noedges2.nc" from Thompson et al. 2018. Potential connectivity between particle release sites.
     "PRBI_GenAlEx_2009-11-12.csv" genotypes for all Premnas biaculeatus individuals at 16 microsatellite loci in GenAlEx format.
     "PRBI_genepop_2009_11-12.gen.txt" genotypes for all Premnas biaculeatus individuals at 16 microsatellite loci in Genepop format. Used as the input file for Fst                    calculations.
     "surveys2009-09-23.density.csv" number of anemonefish, including Premnas biaculeatus, found at sampling sites in the central Philippines. Used for census density                 calculations.
