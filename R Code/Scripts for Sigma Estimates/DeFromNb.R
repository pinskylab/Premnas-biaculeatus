# niter: number of iterations to produce
# AL: adult lifespan (years)
# alpha: minimum age of maturity (years)
# Waples_Nb: linkage disequilibrium estimate of the number of breeders (e.g., output from NeEstimator based on a single cohort)
# Waples_Nbl95: lower 95% confidence interval for Waples_Nb
# Waples_Nbu95: upper 95% confidence interval for Waples_Nb
# A: length (1D) or area (2D) of the region to which the Nb estimate applies
