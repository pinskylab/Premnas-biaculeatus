Na = No. of Different Alleles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ne = No. of Effective Alleles = 1 / (Sum pi^2),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I = Shannon's Information Index = -1* Sum (pi * Ln (pi)),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ho = Observed Heterozygosity = No. of Hets / N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He = Expected Heterozygosity = 1 - Sum pi^2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uHe = Unbiased Expected Heterozygosity = (2N / (2N-1)) * He,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
F = Fixation Index = (He - Ho) / He = 1 - (Ho / He),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where pi is the frequency of the ith allele for the population & Sum pi^2 is the sum of the squared population allele frequencies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fis = (Mean He - Mean Ho) / Mean He,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fit = (Ht - Mean Ho) / Ht,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fst = (Ht - Mean He) / Ht,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nm = [(1 / Fst) - 1] / 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Key: Mean He = Average He across the populations.  Mean Ho = Average Ho across the populations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ht = Total Expected Heterozygosity = 1 - Sum tpi^2 where tpi is the frequency of the ith allele for the total & Sum tpi^2 is the sum of the squared total allele frequencies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
